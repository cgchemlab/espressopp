************************************
**CapForce** - Integrator Extension
************************************

This class can be used to forcecap all particles or a group of particles.
Force capping means that the force vector of a particle is rescaled
so that the length of the force vector is <= capforce  

Example Usage:
-----------------

>>> capforce     = espresso.integrator.CapForce(system, 1000.0)
>>> integrator.addExtension(capForce)

CapForce can also be used to forcecap only a group of particles:

>>> particle_group = [45, 67, 89, 103]
>>> capforce       = espresso.integrator.CapForce(system, 1000.0, particle_group)
>>> integrator.addExtension(capForce)
