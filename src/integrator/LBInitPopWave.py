**LBInitPopWave** - creates initial populations with uniform density and harmonic velocity
******************************************************************************************

This class creates initial populations with uniform density and harmonic velocity:
v_x = 0, v_y = 0, v_z = Amp * sin (2 * \pi * i / N_x)

This may be used to test the system: total moment is zero and the liquid tends to equilibrium,
i.e. relaxes to uniform zero velocity.
