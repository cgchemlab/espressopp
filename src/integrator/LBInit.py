********************************************************************
**LBInit** - abstract base class for LatticeBoltzmann initialization
********************************************************************

This abstract class provides the interface for derived classes that 
(re)initialize populations and handle external forces.
  
It provides the following methods:

* createDenVel(rho0,u0)
    sets initial density and velocity 
* setForce()
    sets external force
* addForce()
    adds a new force to the existing one
