**************************************
**AdResS** - Object
**************************************

The AdResS object is an extension to the integrator. It makes sure that the
integrator also processes the atomistic particles and not only the CG particles.
Hence, this object is of course only used when performing AdResS or H-AdResS
simulations.

In detail the AdResS extension makes sure:
---------------------------------------------

* that also the forces on the atomistic particles are initialized and set to
  by Adress::initForces
* that also the atomistic particles are integrated and propagated by
  Adress::integrate1 and Adress::integrate2

Example - how to turn on the AdResS integrator extension:

>>> adress      = espressopp.integrator.Adress(system)
>>> integrator.addExtension(adress)


.. function:: espressopp.integrator.Adress(_system, _verletlist, _fixedtuplelist, KTI)

		:param _system: 
		:param _verletlist: 
		:param _fixedtuplelist: 
		:param KTI: (default: False)
		:type _system: 
		:type _verletlist: 
		:type _fixedtuplelist: 
		:type KTI: 
"""
